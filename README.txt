Achievements

Fundamentals - 500
==================

Scale (100)
The volcano should appear large and overbearing. The mountains/hills and pyramids make the player feel small - David vs. Goliath feel.

Animation (100)
The sun will animate through the sky as the scene transitions from night to day.
The artifact at the top of the pyramid acts as a spotlight. An animation rotates the artifact, sweeping the scene with a spotlight.

Lighting (100)
Directional - Sun (Realtime)
Point lights - Flaming monkey head columns (Baked), Artifact at the top of the pyramid (Baked), tops of volcanoes (Baked)

Locomotion (100)
Teleport around the play area. Same locomotion from Udacity VR Project 1 - Rube Goldberg.

Physics (100)
I created two cannon-like launcher gameobjects for the volcanoes. To randomize the trajectories, the rotation of the launcher and the added force have an element of randomness.

Completeness - 750
==================

Gamification (250)
Survive until dawn by teleporting, ducking, and dodging the lava bombs
If you get hit by a lava bomb, you die and the level restarts

AI (250)
Boids animation - birds flying around at dawn if you win the game!

3D Modeling (250)
Models created in Blender
Pyramid
Artifact
Volcano
Lava bomb
Monkey head column

Wife
Thought the original gameplay with one volcano was too easy. Suggested that I reduce the game area a bit to give the player less space to avoid the lava bombs.
Suggested I add a second volcano to give the player another element to pay attention to, increasing difficulty.

Daughter
Add more levels and make them progressively harder (more lava bombs, decreased gameplay area). I didnâ€™t have enough time to do this, but makes sense as a future feature.
Add coins, stars, gems, or anything else for the player to collect. Collectibles could incentivize players to venture into the middle of the gameplay area despite the chance of getting hit by a lava bomb. I could create a leaderboard ranking players by the number of collectibles they found while playing. Alternatively, instead of a time-based system, it might be interesting to tie progression with collecting a certain number of stars or coins.
